A US-based bike-sharing provider, BoomBikes, is facing significant revenue declines due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To revive its business post-lockdown and economic recovery, the company aims to develop a linear model to predict demand for shared bikes and identify key variables influencing revenues.

Business Objective:
The objective is to model demand for shared bikes using available independent variables. This model will aid management in understanding demand variations and adjusting business strategies accordingly to meet customer expectations and capitalize on market dynamics in the post-pandemic scenario.
